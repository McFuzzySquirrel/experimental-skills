## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Split the bundled architecture ADR into one record per decision** (`docs/adr/`). `0001-skill-review-architecture.md` covered six decisions in a single file, which left it with no meaningful status and no way to supersede any one decision. It is replaced by `0001-static-heuristic-scoring.md`, `0002-six-scoring-axes.md`, `0003-modular-provider-pattern.md`, `0004-typescript-tsx-no-compile-step.md`, `0005-portable-standalone-skill-package.md`, and `0006-on-disk-folder-presence-scoring.md`, all keeping the original 2026-07-22 date and Accepted status.
- **Added `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/adr/index.md`.** The `System Architecture: Two-Layer Review` section, its Mermaid diagram, and the layer comparison table moved out of the ADR, because they describe the system rather than a decision. The new index lists every record. The README file-layout tree and Architecture section were updated to match.
- Negative-consequence bullets in records 0002, 0003, 0004, and 0006 are marked as inferred, because the original record stated no downside for those decisions. Review and confirm or cut them.

### Fixed

- **False-positive nested reference chain warning** (`rubric.ts`): the structural check matched `references/[^)]+\.md.*references/[^)]+\.md`, and `[^)]` also matches newlines. Any skill without a `)` character that mentioned a document and loaded a reference on the same line was reported as chaining, even though nothing chained. The check is now evaluated per line and only fires when a single line names two distinct reference paths. A regression test in `rubric.test.ts` covers both the clean and flagged cases.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **References folder detection** (`rubric.ts`): `hasRefsDir`, `hasAssetsDir`, and `hasScriptsDir` were passed into `AuditInput` but never forwarded to the scoring or suggestion functions — on-disk folder presence was silently ignored. All three flags are now passed through correctly.
- **Progressive disclosure scoring**: a skill with an existing `references/` or `assets/` directory on disk now scores ≥ 2, even if the folder is not yet linked in `SKILL.md`. Previously it would score 1 and receive a misleading "Create a references/ directory" suggestion.
- **Validation scoring**: a `scripts/` directory present on disk now counts the same as a `scripts/` reference in `SKILL.md` when computing the validation score.
- **Misleading suggestion text**: when a `references/` or `assets/` directory already exists on disk and the progressive disclosure score is 1, the suggestion now reads "Link your existing `references/` files in `SKILL.md` and add load triggers" instead of "Create a `references/` directory".

### Added

- **`--skills-dir` / `-d` CLI flag** (`skill-review.ts`): scan a specific root folder for `SKILL.md` files, overriding the standard auto-detection paths (`.agents/skills/`, `skills/`, etc.). Useful when skills are stored in a custom or non-standard location.

### Documentation

- Added comprehensive `README.md` with full installation guide, CLI reference table, auto-detection logic explanation, providers table, troubleshooting section, and architecture pointer.
- Added `docs/adr/0001-skill-review-architecture.md` — Architecture Decision Record covering static heuristics vs LLM scoring, the six-axis rubric design, the modular provider pattern, TypeScript + tsx runtime choice, portable skill package design, and on-disk folder detection rationale.
- Added `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Initial release of `skill-review`.
- Six-axis rubric scoring each skill 1–3 on: Context economy, Gotchas coverage, Procedural clarity, Progressive disclosure, Calibration, Validation.
- `scripts/rubric.ts` — heuristic scoring engine and Markdown report formatter.
- `scripts/skill-review.ts` — CLI entry point with `--provider`, `--files`, `--min-score`, `--fail-below`, and `--root` flags.
- `scripts/detect.ts` — skill file discovery, git diff–based change detection, and path validation helpers.
- Modular provider pattern with implementations for GitHub (`github.ts`), GitLab (`gitlab.ts`), Azure DevOps (`ado.ts`), and stdout (`stdout.ts`).
- CI example workflows for GitHub Actions (`ci-examples/github-actions.yml`) and Azure DevOps (`ci-examples/azure-pipelines.yml`).
- Portable standalone skill package at `templates/skills/skill-review/` — a self-contained directory with `SKILL.md`, embedded scripts, and `package.json` that can be dropped into any project's skill directory.
- TypeScript throughout; validated with `npm run typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`).
